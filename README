About
=====
Math Adder is an education game aimed at practicing some basics of arithmetic.
It was originally written as a semester long project at the University of
Delaware on educational game development targetting the OLPC XO laptops.

Running the Game
================
Windows/Linux/OS X:
	$ cd MathAdder.activity
	$ python test_launcher.py
	Additional options for launching the game fullscreen/at other resolutions
	$ python test_launcher.py -h

OLPC XO:
	Method 1: Activity Bundle
		An activity bundle (extension .xo) can be built on the XO or on another
		machine with the following:
		$ cd MathAdder.activity
		$ python setup.py dist_xo
		You can then copy the .xo to the XO and install it from the network,
		a USB stick inside sugar.
	Method 2: Development mode
		With the source code on the XO, in the terminal activity,
		$ cd MathAdder.activity
		$ python setup.py dev
		And then you can restart sugar with control + alt + erase, and the
		it should show up as an activity inside sugar.

Translating
===========
The first step for translating is to generate an up to date .pot file as the
base for your translations. You can do this by running
$ python setup.py genpot
The resulting pot file will be in the po/ directory. Copy this to a po file
for the language of your choosing, named with your language's country code. For 
example, a spanish language translation should be named po/es.po

To test your translated file, you must first build the compiled versions of the 
translations. You can do this with
$ python setup.py build
and then run the game in the usual way.
